## Overview

This project is designed to gradually develop an end-to-end stock market prediction system, starting from data engineering to financial analysis and eventually machine learning-driven predictions.

Each phase focuses on a specific aspect — building modular, cloud-ready code that can later integrate with AI microservices. The goal is to create a comprehensive system that:

- Collects and processes stock market data from multiple sources
- Analyzes financial statements and key financial ratios
- Builds predictive models for stock price trends
- Deploys the solution as a scalable cloud service
