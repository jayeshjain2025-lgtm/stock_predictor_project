# ðŸ§­ Stock Trend Predictor â€“ Learning Roadmap

## Goal
To build a complete AI-driven system that studies market trends, analyzes financial indicators, and predicts stock movements in real-time.

## Phase 1: Data Engineering & Automation
### Goal: Collect, clean, and automate the retrieval of stock market data.
### Milestones
- Learn and use yfinance for fetching historical data.
- Store and manage data using CSV/SQLite.
- Automate data refresh scripts (schedulers, cron jobs, or APIs).
- Integrate cloud storage (AWS / Azure).
### Mini Projects
- Fetch and visualize live stock prices.
- Automate daily stock data download.

## Phase 2: Finance 101 for Coders
### Goal: Understand financial concepts and apply them through Python.
### Milestones
- Stock Info Module (Market Cap, EPS, P/E, P/B, ROE, D/E, Dividend Yield).
- Moving Averages (SMA, EMA) implementation.
- Moving Average Crossover Strategy (Buy/Sell visualization).
- RSI & MACD indicators (optional but helpful).
### Mini Projects
- Build a financial metrics dashboard using Streamlit.
- Compare indicators of top 3 random stocks using yfinance.

## Phase 3: Data Visualization & Analysis
### Goal: Turn raw data into actionable visuals.
### Milestones
- Use matplotlib and plotly for trend visualization.
- Plot buy/sell signals from strategies.
- Add correlation and performance comparison charts.

## Phase 4: Machine Learning & Predictions
### Goal: Use ML to predict price trends and risk levels.
### Milestones
- Feature engineering from historical data.
- Build and train predictive models (Random Forest, LSTM).
- Evaluate accuracy using RMSE or Sharpe Ratio.
- Backtest and refine model strategies.

## Phase 5: Deployment & Cloud Integration
### Goal: Turn the model into a real product.
### Milestones
- Host app using Streamlit / Gradio.
- Integrate real-time APIs.
- Automate retraining and monitoring.
- Deploy on cloud (AWS / Azure).

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand stock market fundamentals & data behavior.
- Write production-grade data pipelines and financial models.
- Build end-to-end ML pipelines from data to deployment.
- Apply cloud & DevOps skills in a finance-based project.
